# Simple Library API

## Description

This is a simple Library Management System designed to manage books, libraries, and members.
The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the following entities:

- **Books**: Manage book details, including title, author, book code, publication date, and availability status.
- **Libraries**: Manage library information, including name, location, and list of books available in the library.
- **Members**: Manage member information, including name, membership ID, email, and borrowed books.

The API provides endpoints for:

- Adding new books, libraries, and members.
- Retrieving details of existing books, libraries, and members.
- Updating information for books, libraries, and members.
- Deleting books, libraries, and members from the system.

The system aims to simplify the management of library resources and enhance user experience in accessing and managing books.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Required environment variables:

These variables are essential for the application's configuration and should be defined in a .development.env file in the root directory of the project.

- `DB_USER`: Username for database connection set to PostgreSQL.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for the database user.
- `DB_HOST`: Host address for the database (example: localhost).
- `DB_PORT`: Port for database connections.
- `DB_NAME`: Name of the database set to PostgreSQL
- `PORT_APP`: Port for the application.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the database, combining the above variables for easy connection.

The application uses the NEON (PostgreSQL) database and runs on port 8000.

> ### Example .env file:
>
> ```.env
> DB_USER=
> DB_PASSWORD=
> DB_HOST=
> DB_NAME=
> PORT_APP=8000
> DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/${DB_NAME}
> ```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod

# Prisma commands
$ npx prisma migrate dev  # Apply migrations
$ npx prisma generate      # Generate Prisma client
```
